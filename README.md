# Workshops (ws)
These are weekly assignments that prove a student's understanding of the material taught that week. This is the first course where there is no breakdown of these assignments (Before being **in-lab** and **at-home** workshops).


# Milestones (ms)
Milestones are a breakdown of a project. These are assigned within the last couple of weeks of the term and to be completed alongside weekly assignments.
