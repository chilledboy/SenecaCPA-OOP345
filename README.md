# Workshops (ws)
These are weekly assignments that prove a student's understanding of the material taught that week. This is the first course where there is no breakdown of these assignments. The student is expected to finish that one workshop in that week on their own. The instructions are much less specific than before.


# Milestones (ms)
The milestones are a breakdown of a project. These are assigned within the last couple of weeks of the term and to be completed alongside the weekly assignments. Each milestone can be given a week to a few days to complete.


# Other things to note
* Depending on the workshop or milestone, header and implementation files may have already been provided by the professor. Oftentimes it is the header and main files that's given. **To see if it has been provided, check lab instructions (docx file).**

* All work for this course is submitted via BlackBoard rather than previously being PuTTy.
